\begin{itemize}
\item What does \texttt{toysFrequentist}-Option fit to exactly?\\
\item Are we using \texttt{combine} correctly?
\item Is there a difference between MultiDimFit and multidimensional MaxLikelihoodFit? Is the latter sensible at all? Which one is better?
\item Is there an easier way to obtain process normalizations with a MultiDimFit?
\item If current work flow is incorrect: is there a way to achieve our goals without defining a custom physics model?
\end{itemize}

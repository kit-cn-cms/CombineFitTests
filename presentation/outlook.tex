\begin{block}{Toy Generation with \texttt{combine}}
\begin{itemize}
\item bias for $\mu = 0$ vanished when generating 100 toys
\item bias reemerged when generating the toys separately from each other
\item bias persisted for different additional options
\item still trying to find explanation
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Next Steps}

\begin{itemize}
\item trying to understand origin of bias
\item maybe restructure scripts to make toy generation with \texttt{combine} more efficient
\item starting preparation of scripts for the actual study
\item waiting for further input from expert
\end{itemize}

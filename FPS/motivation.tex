\section{Motivation}

\subsection{Goals of the Study}
\begin{frame}{Goals}
\begin{block}{Perform Analysis Study for Current Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item What happens if background cross section is wrong?
\item How robust is the fit against different hypotheses?
\item Is it possible to perform sensible fits with a different hypothesis for different processes?
\item How do processes which were scaled differently than the nominal expectation influence combine fit results?
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\end{frame}

\subsection{Analysis Strategy}

\begin{frame}{Analysis Strategy}
\begin{block}{Prepare Test Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Scale BDT template histograms for certain processes
\item Generate toy data from scaled histograms
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Evaluate Test Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fit original BDT templates to generated toys
\item Collect fit results
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Expectations for Robust Fit}
\begin{itemize}
\item Fitted signal strength should not be influenced
\item Deviations of the toy data from the background model should be absorbed in the uncertainties\\
$\rightarrow$ should be reflected in nuisance parameter pulls
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
